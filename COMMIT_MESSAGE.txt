fix: Make deployment resilient for forks without environment variables

Changes:
- Add fallback values for Supabase env vars to prevent build failures
- Replace hard errors with console warnings when env vars are missing
- Create .env.example template for fork owners
- Add comprehensive deployment documentation (DEPLOYMENT.md)
- Update README with quick start guide and setup instructions
- Update .gitignore to allow .env.example in repository

Benefits:
- Forks can now deploy successfully without configuration
- Clear documentation for setting up Supabase credentials
- Graceful degradation when database is not configured
- Better developer experience for contributors

Fixes deployment issues reported by fork owners on Vercel.
